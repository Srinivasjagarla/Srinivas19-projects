priority-based process scheduler with round-robin support:
Priority scheduling is one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems. 
Each process is assigned a priority. The process with the highest priority is to be executed first and so on. 
Processes with the same priority are executed on a first-come first served basis. 
Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement. 
Also priority can be decided on the ratio of average I/O to average CPU burst time.
Implementation: 
1- First input the processes with their burst time 
   and priority.
2- Sort the processes, burst time and priority
   according to the priority.
3- Now simply apply FCFS algorithm.
